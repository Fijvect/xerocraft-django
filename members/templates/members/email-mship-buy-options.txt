| Work-Trade Memberships |

If you have time to donate to the upkeep and operation of Xerocraft, you may be interested in
one of the following Work-Trade options:

   - Volunteer 6 hours and pay $25 for a 1 month membership
   - Volunteer 9 hours and pay $10 for a 1 month membership
   - Volunteer 1 hour and receive a 2 hour membership at no charge

Volunteer work must be coordinated in advance with Xerocraft's staff. Contact volunteer@xerocraft.org if you have questions about Work-Trade or if you'd like to enroll.

Thanks for supporting Xerocraft!
