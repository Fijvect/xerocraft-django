        <p>Hi {{member.first_name}},</p>
        <p>
            Thanks for visiting Xerocraft on {{bad_visit | date:"D M d"}} at
            {{bad_visit | time:"g:iA"}}! But, unfortunately, you visited during paid member hours
            without an active paid membership.
            {% if paid_membership %}
            Your most recent paid membership ended on {{paid_membership.end_date | date:"D M d, Y"}}.
            {% endif %}
        </p>
