        <p>Hi {{member.first_name}},</p>
        <p>Your hours worked month-to-date total has changed. Here is what we have for you so far this month:</p>
        <ul>{% for work in work_list %}<li>{{work.work_duration|duration_str}} on {{work.work_date}}</li>{% endfor %}</ul>
        <p>That's {{total|duration_str}}, total. If your most recent work doesn't appear on this report, please allow a few days for data entry.</p>
        <p>Thanks!</p>
    </body>
