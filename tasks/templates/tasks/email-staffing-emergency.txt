Help!

The following HIGH PRIORITY task{{tasks|pluralize}} {{tasks|pluralize:"is,are"}} scheduled for TODAY but {{tasks|pluralize:"is,are"}} not yet staffed:

{% for task in tasks %}    {{task.short_desc}} @ {{task.work_start_time|time:"H:i A"}}
{% endfor %}
This is bad! If you can help, please "respond to all" and let us know via email.

Thanks in advance,
